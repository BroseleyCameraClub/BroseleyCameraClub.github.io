  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The primary topic was how to find the ‘sweet spot’ of the lens you are using. By ‘sweet spot’ we mean the aperture that provides the sharpest image.</p>

<p>The process, though simple, may take a little time. You will need to place your camera in a secure place - preferably a tripod – then point your camera at your desired target/subject. Either open or close the aperture on your lens to its limit and take a photograph. Without moving the camera or changing the subject take photographs at each aperture available on your lens until to reach the opposite end of the aperture scale from which you started. That is, if you start at f2.8 change the aperture to f3.5 (or whatever the next stop is on the lens) then each stop until you reach the end of the aperture range. Review the photographs taken. Make a note of the sharpest photograph or photographs and the f stop with which the photograph was taken. You have now found the ‘sweet spot’ for that lens.</p>

<p>For those of you that use a ‘compact’ camera, find the aperture control within the camera setting (usually on the moveable dial on the rear of the camera) and proceed as stated on the previous paragraph. </p>

<p>A change to the annual programme is made for the November meeting. We have arranged for Van Greaves FRPS to provide us with a talk. Van has several books of photographs published that include “Moods of Shropshire &amp; The Marches” and “Worcestershire &amp; Elgar Country”.
