<h1>Welcome to Brosely Camera Club's Website</h1>

  <br/><br/>

    We are a friendly bunch of like minded people, who get together and discuss as many aspects of photography as we can. We get together only once a month, having a break in August and December. The meetings are very informal and easy to follow.

  <br/> <br/>

    We have workshops and presentations that suit all abilities, from beginner to advanced, phone camera to DSLR. There really is something for everyone. For more please read through our <a href="/about/">'About Page'</a> for more about our club.

  <br/> <br/>

    Please feel free to browse through our <a href="/gallery/">galleries</a> and <a href="/news/">snippets</a> from our members newsletters. Take a look at what we are up to this year in our <a href="/programme/">Programme</a> and/or contact us to find out more.
