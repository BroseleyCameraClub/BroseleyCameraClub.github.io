  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This month we departed from our usual format by handing over the topic for the evening to the attending members. The object of the evening was to introduce individual members favoured topic and genre of photography rather than those requested in our competitions.</p>

<p>We had some interesting items shown and discussed by everyone. Those of us on the committee gained some knowledge from which future presentations and competitions can be organised. It is expected that this type of ‘open’ evening shall be repeated occasionally – perhaps annually.</p>

<p>After all those that wanted to show their images had done so we moved onto the evenings competitions.</p>

<p>The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled ‘Curves’ was held.</p>

<p>The winners were:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Curves in the Sand' by Hugh Stanton</li>
	<li>2nd - 'View Tube' by John Watkinson</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Under the Arches' by Joan Banks</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Some of these images have been cropped for a better fit for the website.
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Please note that entries (rectangular, up to 7 x 5 ins) for the Monthly competition can be made without mounts – when needed, mounts will be available at the start of the session.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The ‘Jan Lancaster Memorial’ entitled ‘Columns’ was held.</p>

<p>The winners were:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Ancient Pillars'  by Joan Banks</li>
	<li>2nd - 'Columns in the Sand' by John Horton</li>
	<li>3rd - 'The Grime of Time' by Joan Banks</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

</div>
<div class="col three caption">

</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>For this annual competition, entries are accepted in any rectangular shape up to A4 in size. Entries need not be mounted.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Subjects for our next few months “Focus Points” and competitions are provisionally in place. However, we still need the members to provide the committee with some aspects they would like to include in the programme for the next year.</p>

<p>With the sad loss of Jan Lancaster the committee is short of a member. It is therefore requested that the membership think about volunteers to be nominated for election at the February AGM. Would anyone who regularly attends wishes to volunteer please advise the Chairman and/or the Secretary that they wish to be nominated. In general the committee meets just twice a year each meeting lasts about two hours depending upon the details to be discussed.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="next-meeting">NEXT MEETING</h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Our next meeting will be at the Birchmeadow Centre, Broseley at 19:30 on Monday 29th January 2018.</p>

<p>We will be hosting an ‘Water Droplets’, with an additional section regarding the ‘Judging of Photographs’.</p>

<p>There are two competition is entitled…</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly - 'Look Up'</li>
<li>Quarterly - 'Spotty &amp; Dotty'</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="announcment">ANNOUNCMENT</h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>We have discussed this previously, however, please take note that our web-site still has a glaring hole in it – namely the ‘Gallery’. It’s empty. We would like to start to fill this space. Consequently if any members would like to contribute up to 6 images of their work on any subject to be shown in the gallery we would be grateful. All images shown will be credited to the photographer.</p>
