    <p>The aim of this programme, is to give members a varied range of aspects and techniques.  Consisting of Focus Points, that are more discussions, and workshops where you should bring your cameras along to give it a go.</p>

<p><b>Judging</b> – During this focus point, we will be discussing what to look for when judging the BCC’s competitions. The rules and examples of what they mean.</p>

<ul>
  <li>24th February 2014</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Whats in your bag?</b> – What do you carry with you in your camera bag? Is it a lens wipe, spare batteries, a million lenses, just memory cards? Open forum tonight again to discuss simple ideas that may help others learn about very simple equipment that can make a big difference. Remember that piece of A4 white paper…</p>
