<p><b>Exposure</b> – This month we will talk about the basics of exposure. Understand the light on a given situation/subject and the contrasts it will give. What settings on your camera will effect each other. How to adjust your work flow / thought process on exposure. Take control and dare to use ‘Manual Mode’ and ‘meter’ your frame accordingly. Bring your cameras with you, there will be lots of experimenting.</p>

<p><b>Projects at Home</b> – What can you do with minimal equipment? What would you like to do but are unsure how. We need your thoughts for this one, if you don’t make suggestions we can present some ideas for some personal projects to test out the techniques you have learnt over the past 2 seasons and stretch your creativity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>25th March 2013</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Angles</b> – Follow on from the Composition Focus Point in the previous year. Examples of images where the photographer has not used the ‘normal’ angle to take their image, but still follows the ‘rules’ of composition to achieve an appealing image.</p>
