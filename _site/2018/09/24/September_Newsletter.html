  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A bit of an improvised evening we could not get a guest speaker as set out in the annual programme. However, this provided us with the opportunity to look at a number of photographs and a couple of videos. We started off by looking at a few images taken during the evening in Shrewsbury. Though mainly local architecture, a few arboreal and street photography images were viewed. As usual a few comments were made about composition but nothing unreasonable and all the ‘errors’ could be easily avoided with a little thought. The following collection of images were somewhat harder to ‘correct’ as they needed impossible viewpoints and lots of patience – A talk of the club visit to Chester Zoo. It seems that the animals on view were anything but co-operative. Having said that, many of the images shown were well received.</p>

<p>We then went onto a brief discussion about photo’ software. Not everyone has, or indeed wants, Lightroom or Photoshop. A number of free products are available including <a href="http://www.faststone.org/" target="_blank">Faststone</a> and <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>. Graham gave a short demonstration of ‘Faststone’. GIMP is a little more sophisticated and based upon Photoshop Elements. Should anyone require a tutorial on this type of software please contact either Graham or myself.</p>

<p>There followed a couple of videos by an American photographer about how to deal with silhouettes and photographing directly into the Sun. Short in duration they were very informative. If anyone wants to view either video again please contact Graham.</p>

<p>The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled ‘Showers &amp; Inclement Weather’ was held.</p>

<p>The winners were:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Waiting in the Rain' by Sue Poole</li>
	<li>2nd - 'Storm in a Tea Cup' by Joan Banks</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Between Showers' by Judy Moore</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Please note that entries (rectangular, up to 7 x 5 ins) for the Monthly competition can be made without mounts – when needed, mounts will be available at the start of the session.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In future newsletters we shall be advising you of whatever events we can discover that should provide some interesting photo opportunities. They may or may not be relevant to the discussions of the previous or immediate future meetings but should be of photographic interest in their own right. A little traveling may be required but we’ll keep the items as local as possible.</p>
