  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This evening’s main topic was ‘Fireworks’.</p>

<p>Having sorted through several books John discovered that only a single page in one edition provided any guidance on photographing fireworks – the relevant section of that article was read out. That took care of 3 or 4 minutes. To add substance to the article a number of YouTube video’s  were checked only to find that most were American and far too verbose and long-winded. Eventually a British video was found – imaginatively titles “How to Photograph Fireworks” – by The School of Photography based in Essex. The video lasted about 5 minutes and showed a number of images and succinctly told of the manner in which they were produced. This was followed by another video – of about 15 minutes – by Chris Bray Photography entitled “Top 10 Composition Tips”. It was suggested that the members re-view the videos at their leisure.</p>

<p>Last year we held an exhibition of the clubs work at the Ironbridge 1940’s Gala, we are going to do the same event next May. In the meantime would all members who would like to exhibit please think of a 1940’s themed image(s) for which they would provide A4 mounted print(s) - sorry but we cannot provide mounts – for the event. We’ll provide more details when known.</p>

<p>To date we have not decided upon an evening out or day trip next year. Would you please provide some suggestions for our January meeting.</p>

<p>As one of next years competitions is titled “Market Day” it was suggested that you take the opportunity provided by the Christmas Market events, taking place in various towns locally, to enjoy a day out and produce some images that could be entered for the competition.</p>
