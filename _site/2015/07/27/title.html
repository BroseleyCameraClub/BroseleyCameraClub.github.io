    <p>The Chairman explained what was meant by Replication, showing a number of slides and examples in the process. You may consider the process to be one of copying. However, it is more akin to inspiration and adaptation. We learn by copying and adapting what is learned so that we create our own style, motifs and character. This is true of life as well as photography. As a child we copy the sounds of the people around us in order to learn language, then adapt the sounds in order to express our thoughts and feeling. A similar process occurs in our photography - we see, adapt, change where necessary and then express our thoughts in pictures. In short we “Replicate”.</p>

<p>It can be an essential tool to learning, breaking down an image to find out how the artist took it, then replicating the technique and noting your results.</p>
