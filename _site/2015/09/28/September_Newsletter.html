  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Everyone was welcomed to the start of a new year of topics, competitions and workshops at the club.</p>

<p>The Chairman briefly introduced the 2015/16 programme of events and the items that will be used for the various competitions.</p>

<p>Tonight the topic for discussion was…</p>

<p>:: Question &amp; Answers ::</p>

<p>This was a session that comprehensively covered a number of items those present had concerns about. It was an open forum where anything could be asked.</p>

<p>We then went on to the important topic of the Club’s location. It has been proposed by the local authority that the library is to be altered in such a way that we may not find conducive to the clubs activities. Consequently it is highly likely (almost certain) that the club will need to find alternative accommodation. The Committee discussed the situation at a recent meeting. The owners of a number of alternative sites have been contacted and it looks as if the club will be moving to the Birchmeadow Centre. However, it is likely that any ‘new’ premises will attract a higher rental. The Committee decided that in the event of a rent rise the club fees would remain the same for at least the next year - the difference being made up from the clubs existing resources. All details regarding a move of venue will be emailed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The club will also be conducting another Exhibition at the Birchmeadow Centre, much as we did last year - date and details to be confirmed as soon as known. In addition to this Exhibition we are attempting to find another location in the Ironbridge area for a further Exhibition sometime during the tourist season. This would enable the exhibitors to show their work to a greater audience as the footfalls in Ironbridge are no doubt greater than those in Broseley itself. When more details are known you will, of course, be informed.</p>

<p>The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled ‘Replication’ was held.</p>

<p>The winners were:-</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Tong Church' - John Wyman</li>
	<li>2nd - 'Trinity Church Reflection' - Tony Grevett</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Oil on Water ' - Sue Poole</li>
</ul>
