    <p>This evening’s main topic was ‘Architectural Photography’.</p>

<p>It was pointed out that this style of photography is plagued by legal restraints – to do mainly with Military establishments – in several countries. Interior photography also has rules ranging from copyright to ownership restrictions. You may come across some of these when taking photographs of the interiors of historic – usually religious – building where the sign “do not use flash photography” (or words meaning something similar) are displayed.</p>

<p>Briefly the styles described in the presentation centred around the following aspects:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>Exterior from a distance, in differing weather conditions and/or lighting at various times of day.</li>
	<li>Close-up, as descriptive or abstract.</li>
	<li>As part of a general scene to include people of other factors.</li>
	<li>Reflections – in glass or water – of both exterior and interior parts of the building.</li>
	<li>Interiors – of the building itself or of its fixtures and fittings.</li>
	<li>The use of shadows in accentuating aspects of the subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>Members receive a copy of the presentation in the club newsletter.</p>

<h3 id="notes">NOTES</h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Should anyone have any extra photographs that they would like to be assessed please bring it/them along. If we have time we’ll definitely appraise the photograph.</p>

<p>In response to a question about the ‘Gallery’ on the club web-site it was confirmed that we require as many as possible of the members to provide some images (not necessarily any previously shown in our competitions) for inclusion in the ‘Gallery’. Each contributor will retain copyright and will be credited with taking the image.
Please forward your images directly to Graham for inclusion on the site.</p>

<p>Joan mentioned a club outing to the ‘National Memorial Arboretum’ near Alrewas. Would anyone wanting to go please advise Joan a.s.a.p. Payment will be in advance and depends upon the size of the transport to be hired. A provisional date of 15th June is still to be confirmed and may depend upon the number attending – friends and family may also attend.</p>
