I"u<p>Our main topic for the evening was about the effect shutter speed has on the image. A short slide show was given by Graham showing the various aspects of controlling the light entering the camera and the effect it has on depth of field and the amount of sharpness and blur. The presentation was followed by a ‘workshop’. As light was fading fast outside the venue the workshop was conducted indoors by John (muggins) ‘riding’ his exercise bike. Several members took the opportunity of photographing the victim pedalling his machine. By using differing apertures and shutter speeds they learned the effects and amount of blur produced.</p>

<p>The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled ‘Hallways’ was held.</p>
