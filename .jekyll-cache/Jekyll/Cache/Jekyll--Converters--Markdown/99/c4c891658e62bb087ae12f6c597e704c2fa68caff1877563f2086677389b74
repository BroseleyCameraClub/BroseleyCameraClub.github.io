I"¿<p>This eveningâ€™s main topic was â€˜Change Your Perspectiveâ€™.</p>

<p>Tonight, after a minor disaster with the OHP, we welcomed our â€˜newcomersâ€™ and explained the clubs ethos and ambitions.</p>

<p>A â€˜lectureâ€™ explaining the manner in which simply changing the photographers stance could totally change the image then taken. By looking up or down, by getting higher or lower can also effect the overall composition of the image. After the photographers eyes and their camera the most important â€˜toolâ€™ the photographer has are their â€˜feet and legsâ€™ whereby a little movement can alter the overall tone and content of the picture. The talk was then followed by a short â€˜workshopâ€™</p>

<p><strong><em>Please note:</em></strong> Everyone is encouraged to bring their camera with them to each of this years meetings as we may, if time allows, hold a â€˜workshopâ€™ during the evening.</p>
