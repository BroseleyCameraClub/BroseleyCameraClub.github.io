<p>This eveningâ€™s presentation was about streaks of light also called <em>Light Trails</em>. These are usually produced in the evening or at night and predominately consist of either traffic or astronomical bodies such as meteor showers or stars. The images are taken of a moving object over a long exposure period thereby creating the trails of light. It is highly recommended that a tripod is used to provide a firm and fixed base for the camera.</p>

<p>A number of images were shown as examples as too were images of <em>â€œpainting with lightâ€</em>. The details of <em>â€œpainting with lightâ€</em> were discussed and are â€“ for our purposes â€“ totally different from â€œlight trailsâ€. With â€œpainting with lightâ€ the photographer is in control of the light source, whereas with â€œlight trailsâ€ they are not.</p>
