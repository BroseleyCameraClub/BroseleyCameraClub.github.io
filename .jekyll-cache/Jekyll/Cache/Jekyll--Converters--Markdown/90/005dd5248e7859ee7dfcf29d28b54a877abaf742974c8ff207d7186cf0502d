I"Ù<p>For the first time in the history of the club we had a guest speaker.</p>

<p>:: STEVE ELLIOTT ::</p>

<p>The local photographer was kind enough to provide us with some of his time and expertise.</p>

<p>Initially Steve showed a few images of various quality and contend, asking the members what they liked and wanted to know. The main image of interest was a very unusual wedding photograph to which Steve explained the details and thoughts behind the content of the image. He then went on to show and discuss some nighttime photographs heâ€™d taken.</p>

<p>Following the discussion about the photographs Steve gave us an abridged history of how he got into photography - particularly corporate event and live-band photography.</p>

<p>The very interesting talk lasted for about an hour - many thanks to Steve for his time and contribution. If anyone wants to see Steveâ€™s work or to contact him, he is available on steveelliottimages.co.uk</p>
