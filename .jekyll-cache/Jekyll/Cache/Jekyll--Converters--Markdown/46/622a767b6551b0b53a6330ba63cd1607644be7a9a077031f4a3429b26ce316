I"¯<p>Tonightâ€™s presentation was on the topic of High Key and Low Key Photography. These techniques are primarily a method of introducing drama and emotion into a photograph.</p>

<p>High Key -Â Lots of light and generally used in portraiture of women. It introduces a â€˜softâ€™ edge to the subject. Though normally produced in a studio environment it can be used outside with a large aperture setting and lots of back lighting.</p>

<p>Low Key -Â Low levels of light picking up the highlights of the subject. Generally used in portraiture of men â€“ especially men with â€˜craggy contoursâ€™. Dark, moody, sinister scenes can be produced using this technique.</p>

<p>We are <strong>NOT</strong> meeting at the Birchmeadow for our next meeting. We have our summer outing and are visiting Ironbridge. Meeting is still on for 7:30pm, meeting at the War Memorial by the Bridge. We will have a walk about, giving members a chance to ask questions from committee members about particular issues they may have with their cameras and photography.</p>

<p>Nearest parking situated to the meeting spot is <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Ironbridge+Coach+Park/@52.6264369,-2.4856584,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48707edb841356d9:0xb9d7f295c647d97d!8m2!3d52.6264337!4d-2.4834644?hl=en" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
