I"<p>This evening we held our annual photographic outing. Our venue this year was Shrewsbury town centre, where we met at 19:30. After a brief discussion about the aims of the evening, everyone went their separate ways to take photographs of their interpretation of the local architecture and general locality. It was arranged that we meet up at the â€˜Admiral Benbowâ€™ in Swan Hill at 20:45.</p>

<p>Upon meeting at the â€˜Admiral Benbowâ€™ it was stated that the clubâ€™s website has now introduced a gallery of the members work. To date, five members have submitted images but we would like more pictures from other members. Please send them directly to Graham.</p>

<p>The trip to Chester Zoo was also mentioned and those that attended took some interesting images that we hope to display at the next meeting. We would also like to display some of the images taken in Shrewsbury â€“ so, we would like to produce to â€˜Featured Galleriesâ€™ for the website. So again, please send them to Graham to add to the website.</p>

<p>We have been contacted by two members of the press for them to write articles about the club and show some of the images taken over the last year. The organisations asking for the details are â€˜The Bridgnorth Journalâ€™ and â€˜The Broseley Quarterly Magazineâ€™. I have sent a report to the BQM about the clubâ€™s activities that explains our introduction of â€˜Break-out Sessionsâ€™ and our involvement in the Ironbridge 1940â€™s Festival. If you have any images you would like to be considered for these publications please send them as 300 dpi jpeg photographs to either Graham or myself.</p>
