I"¢<p>A quick welcome from the Chairman and continued on with the evenings subject.</p>

<p>This monthâ€™s topic was on <i>â€˜Depth of Fieldâ€™</i>.</p>

<p>Six points to take note of when considering your photograph was discussed. They ranged from composition to focus within the image. A recurring problem seems to be the depth-of-field. This aspect of photography has to learn and constantly practiced, as even the best photographers get it wrong on occasions. A primary point to remember is; the greater the aperture (small â€˜f stop-number) the shallower the depth-of-field â€“ the technique ensures that the main motif is in focus leaving any foreground and/or background out of focus, therefore, directing the eye to the subject of the photograph.</p>

<p>As stated previously, you can find a whole load of tutorial videos on this subject as well as a load of other photography subjects on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>.</p>
