I"[<p>Due to the previous bank holiday - we held the meeting a week later than our usual day.</p>

<p>Our main topic for the night was ‘Framing of the subject’. This wasn’t a demonstration on how to make a wooden frame, nor how to make a custom mount. This was a discussion on how to use objects to create a frame for your subjects, create a little more interest in your images with blurred foreground objects, architectural, natural, and other such items.</p>

<p>Following the presentation, we opened the exhibition, where members and guests could move through to the ‘Bar’ area to view the submitted images. I would like to add here a personal Thanks to all of you who submitted images. I have to say once again the level of quality has been stepped up again. I think that this is certainly one of our best exhibitions to date. I would love to hear some feedback on your thoughts.</p>
