I"S<p>This evening’s topics were predominately Sport and Movement. Involving, mainly, how to capture movement with and without blur. A number of images were shown providing details of indoor and outdoor techniques including artificial lighting to arrest the action. A brief discussion followed on how we may replicate the images shown.</p>

<p>A ‘YouTube’ video was then shown on landscape photography and the use of light in differing situations and at various times of year.</p>

<p>You can view that video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Ulna1lVfI">HERE</a> or watch below.</p>
