I")<p>It has become apparent that the present club year has become disjointed in that the AGM is held in February and the picture competitions are held September to July. As a consequence of this a discussion was held during the evening about a change to the rules. After a look at the various options, it was decided by those members present, that the club year should be the same as the annual calendar year. Our AGM shall henceforth be in January and the competition year shall run January to November. The 2019 competition year is extended to end in November 2019. Club membership fees shall also become due at the first meeting of the new year.</p>

<p><em>“Metering Modes”</em> was the topic to be presented. Fundamentally three metering modes exist (though some camera manufacturers have introduced a fourth), they are:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>Average/Matrix Metering</li>
	<li>Centre Weighted Metering</li>
	<li>Spot Metering</li>
</ul>

<p>Each type was discussed in detail along with how and when to use a particular method. Examples were shown on screen of the various uses of each metering procedure. For more details it is recommended that the user refer to their camera handbook.</p>
