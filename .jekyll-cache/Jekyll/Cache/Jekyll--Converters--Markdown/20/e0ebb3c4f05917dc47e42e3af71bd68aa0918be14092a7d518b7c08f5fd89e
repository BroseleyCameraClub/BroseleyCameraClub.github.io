I"2<p>After confirming the sad news of the death of Jan Lancaster, it was announced that the club would be holding a ‘Memorial Competition’ every November starting next month (See Below for details). Jan worked tirelessly for the club since 1999: her contribution and presence will be sadly missed.</p>

<p>Our topic for the evening was ‘Portraiture’. Several portraits are spoilt by the choice of poor lighting, composition and/or an overwhelming background. A short presentation with the aid of projected examples was given followed by a short video of portraiture and how lighting and choice of background can enhance the result.</p>

<p>The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled ‘Non-flowering Plants’ was held.</p>

<p>The winners were:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Fruit of the Forest' by Joan Banks</li>
	<li>2nd - 'Not for Breakfast' by Joan Banks</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Stairway to Heaven' by Phillip Simmons</li>
</ul>
