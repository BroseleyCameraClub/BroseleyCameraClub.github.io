I"¸<p>This evening we a departed from our usual format, in that we were entertained by Van Greaves FRPS,Â  our guest speaker for the night.</p>

<p>Known by John Horton since the late 1960â€™s, Van is a professional photographer specialising in landscape photography â€“ though of late he has diversified into photography of butterflies and birds. Since gaining his RPS fellowship in the 1990â€™s he has had number of books published that include â€œMoods of Shropshire &amp; The Marchesâ€ and â€œWorcestershire &amp; Elgar Countryâ€.</p>

<p>The evening contained a number of â€˜Audio Visualâ€™ sequences including the â€˜Venetian Carnivalâ€™, â€˜Balloons over Cappadociaâ€™ and various aspects of the British landscape. It should be noted that the main technique was the care taken with the composition of the image: layers, leading lines and so forth. A short Q &amp; A session followed each AV presentation.</p>
