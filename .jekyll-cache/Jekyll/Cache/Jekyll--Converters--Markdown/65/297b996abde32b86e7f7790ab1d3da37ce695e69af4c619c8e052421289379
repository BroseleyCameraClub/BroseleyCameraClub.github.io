I"ò	<p>After welcoming our two new members, we quickly moved onto the topic for the evening â€“ Photo Editing.</p>

<p>Using â€˜Photoshopâ€™ as the software for the presentation a display in how to use the â€˜Cloneâ€™ tool was shown. The features failings as well as its benefits were shown along with ways to adjust the final image. Although â€˜Photoshopâ€™ was used, the â€˜Cloneâ€™ feature is common to all photo-manipulation software and no matter which product is used the processes are basically similar.</p>

<p>As we had two competitions this evening the remainder of the session was spent in assessing, voting and commenting on the entries.</p>
