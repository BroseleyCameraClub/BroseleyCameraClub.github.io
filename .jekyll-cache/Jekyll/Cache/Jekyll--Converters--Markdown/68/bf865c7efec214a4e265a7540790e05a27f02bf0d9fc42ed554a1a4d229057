I"°<p>This monthâ€™s topics were â€˜Water Dropletsâ€™ and â€˜Judging Imagesâ€™.</p>

<p><strong>Water Droplets -</strong>
A presentation was made with the aid of several projected images.  The presentation was in two parts: drops splashing into a substance, followed by droplets on leaves and/or stalks. To make the splash easier it was explained that the liquid (water) could be thickened with gelatine or another agent. This technique slows the splashing process enabling different exposures to be taken. For droplets on a leaf or stalk a macro lens or adapters need to be used. The genre is vast and if interested details and ideaâ€™s can be looked at by checking any of the presentations on â€˜YouTubeâ€™.</p>

<p><strong>Judging Images -</strong>
The discussion was accompanied with a handout explaining the details to look for; among them are the rule of thirds, exposure, sharpness and saturation. The list of tips will be posted on the website - these will be emailed when ready.</p>
