I"<p>The Chairman opened the evening with a short welcoming address and proceeded to explain the running order of the eveningâ€™s events.</p>

<p>The evening was to be rather busy as it contained the club AGM, the monthly competition and a lighting workshop</p>

<p>The AGM.</p>

<p>The Treasurer stated that the club is financially sound and consequently the club subscription fee will remain at Â£1.50 per person per session. Members were asked to provide some ideaâ€™s about some equipment we could purchase.</p>

<p>The members of the present committee were returned unopposed.</p>

<p>An exhibition of â€˜Monochrome Photographyâ€™ has been arranged to take place at the Birchmeadow Centre, Broseley, in the near future. Exhibition open evening is to be held in conjunction with the next meeting.</p>

<p>As the club programme year and the AGM are, for historical reasons, not synchronised it was decided that the two aspects are to be brought into line. The 2016 â€“ 2017 â€˜yearâ€™ shall be from February 2016 to July 2017. The next AGM will therefore take place in July 2017. The 2017 â€“ 2018 year will start, as usual, in the September.</p>

<p>The â€˜Mentorship Schemeâ€™ is to be changed. A questionnaire was given to each member at the meeting. From the answers given each member will be assigned a â€˜Mentorâ€™. Should a member have any photographic query or need assistance they are asked to contact their assigned â€˜Mentorâ€™ for guidance. Email addresses and â€˜phone numbers will be provided as necessary. The details provided by the questionnaire will also help in the production of the 2016 â€“ 2017 programme of events.</p>
