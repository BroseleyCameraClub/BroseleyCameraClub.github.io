I"!<p>The main topic for this evening was “Setting Goals”. A brief presentation was given on how to set and achieve the goals you set for yourself within a photographic context. We kept the presentation short so as to provide sufficient time for the consumption of the ‘party fayre’ brought by Joan.</p>

<p><em>Members receive a copy of the presentation in the club newsletter.</em></p>
