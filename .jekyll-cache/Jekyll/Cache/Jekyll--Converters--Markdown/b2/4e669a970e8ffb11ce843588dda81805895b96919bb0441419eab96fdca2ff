I"þ<p>Tonightâ€™s meeting was our annual â€˜outingâ€™ taking place along the riverside at <em>Ironbridge</em>. The wonderful turnout of members were invited to take a variety of photographs giving their impression of the â€˜World Heritage Siteâ€™. It will be interesting to see some of the results so bring them along to the next meeting. Several new members were welcomed to the club and we hope they had an enjoyable evening.</p>

<p>If you missed it, honestly - â€˜where were you?â€™. The weather held out, it was a lovely sunset, and a nice little stroll.</p>

<p>The photo-shoot took place between 19:30 and 21:00 after which we adjourned to Cleoâ€™s CafÃ© where the showing of the monthly competition took place.</p>

<p>The â€˜Monthly Competitionâ€™ entitled â€˜Insectsâ€™ was held.</p>

<p>The winners were:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Flesh-fly' by Linda Evans</li>
	<li>2nd - 'Bumblebee eating Honey'Â by Joan Banks</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Daddy-long-legs' by Linda Evans</li>
</ul>

<p>As we were in a public space the usual critique session was waived. However, several of the images presented were commented on and discussed amongst those present.</p>
