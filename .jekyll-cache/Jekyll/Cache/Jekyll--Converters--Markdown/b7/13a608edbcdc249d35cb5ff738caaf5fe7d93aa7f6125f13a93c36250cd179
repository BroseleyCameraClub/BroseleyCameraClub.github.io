I"û<p>We have a lot going on this year. We have a mixture of Workshops and Focus Points, but all with practices you will be able to do.</p>

<p>You will need to bring your cameraâ€™s along with you, just in case we try out things from the focus points.</p>

<p>We will also be hosting some mini break out sessions - these are specifically set out to beginners who want to learn a little more about the jargon and techniques. These are planned to be held BEFORE the normal meetings at 7 pm. These will be short Focus Points, but please bring your cameraâ€™s so we can ensure you know how to change your settings.</p>
