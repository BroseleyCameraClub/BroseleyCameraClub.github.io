I"ç<p>A different format for the evenings activities, and an â€˜Open Sessionâ€™ was up for discussion. No competitions were to be held, instead those members present were asked to show a couple of images and explain why and, if possible, how the photographs were taken.</p>

<p>The emphasis of the evening was to find out what type of images are preferred by the photographers, as well as a learning exercise for all who attended.
All got off to a slow start, with no volunteers coming forward with John Horton stepping forward to explained his preferred photographic subject and why. Having â€˜broken the iceâ€™, every member took the floor to present their images in turn. The discussion also included the equipment i.e. camera and, when known, lens used.</p>

<p>Although techniques were mentioned it seems that we still need to repeat some features of photography for anyone new to the process, composition being the main concern.</p>

<p>There were no competitions this month.</p>
