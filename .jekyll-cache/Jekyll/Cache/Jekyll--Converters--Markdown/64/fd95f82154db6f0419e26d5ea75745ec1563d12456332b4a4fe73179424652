<p>Club Chairman Graham Welsby stated‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>I rarely get asked why to shoot in black and white, but when to shoot in black and white and I find that fascinating.</blockquote>

<p>There are many reasons to use Black and White, here are a few points‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
	<li>You see light in a different way, without the colours distracting from the subject.</li>
	<li>Emotions of the image can be emphasised more simply.</li>
	<li>And there is somewhat of a classic, timeless feel to black and white.</li>
</ul>

<p>We discuss these aspects and more in detail in some of our ‚ÄúFocus Point Presentations‚Äù in club meetings.</p>

<p>The exhibition will run from the <b>1st April - 30th June 2016</b> at the <a href="http://www.birchmeadow.org.uk/" alt="Birchmeadow Center Website" target="_blank">Birchmeadow Center</a> in Broseley. Everyone is welcome to view the images on display, although it would be a good idea to check if the Birch Meadow Center is open on the day your looking to come along.</p>

<p>We will be adding an Exhibition Gallery to our website, however, this will not be until the exhibition is over.</p>
