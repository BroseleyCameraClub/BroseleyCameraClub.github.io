I"À<p>This eveningâ€™s main topic was â€˜Architectural Photographyâ€™.</p>

<p>It was pointed out that this style of photography is plagued by legal restraints â€“ to do mainly with Military establishments â€“ in several countries. Interior photography also has rules ranging from copyright to ownership restrictions. You may come across some of these when taking photographs of the interiors of historic â€“ usually religious â€“ building where the sign â€œdo not use flash photographyâ€ (or words meaning something similar) are displayed.</p>

<p>Briefly the styles described in the presentation centred around the following aspects:-</p>

<ul>
	<li>Exterior from a distance, in differing weather conditions and/or lighting at various times of day.</li>
	<li>Close-up, as descriptive or abstract.</li>
	<li>As part of a general scene to include people of other factors.</li>
	<li>Reflections â€“ in glass or water â€“ of both exterior and interior parts of the building.</li>
	<li>Interiors â€“ of the building itself or of its fixtures and fittings.</li>
	<li>The use of shadows in accentuating aspects of the subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>Should anyone have any extra photographs that they would like to be assessed please bring it/them along. If we have time weâ€™ll definitely appraise the photograph.</p>

<p>In response to a question about the â€˜Galleryâ€™ on the club web-site it was confirmed that we require as many as possible of the members to provide some images (not necessarily any previously shown in our competitions) for inclusion in the â€˜Galleryâ€™. Each contributor will retain copyright and will be credited with taking the image.
Please forward your images directly to Graham for inclusion on the site.</p>

<p>Joan mentioned a club outing to the â€˜National Memorial Arboretumâ€™ near Alrewas. Would anyone wanting to go please advise Joan a.s.a.p. Payment will be in advance and depends upon the size of the transport to be hired. A provisional date of 15th June is still to be confirmed and may depend upon the number attending â€“ friends and family may also attend.</p>
