I"Ó<p>Off camera flashâ€ was the topic for this eveningâ€™s presentation. Along with a discussion about the techniques and apparatus used in â€œOff camera flashâ€ â€“  incâ€™ flash-guns, remote sensors and reflectors â€“ a brief workshop was held on the playing fields adjacent to the Birchmeadow Centre. The technique lends itself particularly well to portraiture as was demonstrated during the presentation.</p>
