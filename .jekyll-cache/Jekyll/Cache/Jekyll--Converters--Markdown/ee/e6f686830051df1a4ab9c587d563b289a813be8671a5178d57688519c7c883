I"×<p><strong>We are changing the Membership Fees</strong></p>

<p>We have debated about these changes within the committee for many years now, taking into account various reasons to change or not change. However we feel that this is a good a time as any to implement these for the new 2018-2019 season.</p>

<p>These fees will now include an annualÂ Membership fee of <strong>Â£15</strong>.</p>

<p>There will <em>still</em> be a monthly charge to attending membersâ€¦ however this will be reduced to <strong>50p</strong> per meeting to cover the costs of Coffee/Tea.</p>

<p>This will be starting as of the Feb meeting (25th February 2018).</p>
