I"y<p>We all like a day on the beach now and again so this evening we discussed <em>Beach Scenes</em>. From images of sandy beaches to rocky shorelines and angry seas our presentation provided details of how to produce them all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before taking any pictures, in what could be dangerous situations, your safe location must be your first concern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was recommended that you reconnoitre your chosen site before taking any photographs. Long and short exposure images also with dawn and sunset pictures were shown in a slide show to provide some idea of the type of image that can be produced. If taking photographs on well lit sandy beaches remember that the sand causes the same â€˜problemsâ€™ with respect to exposure as snowy scenes.</p>
