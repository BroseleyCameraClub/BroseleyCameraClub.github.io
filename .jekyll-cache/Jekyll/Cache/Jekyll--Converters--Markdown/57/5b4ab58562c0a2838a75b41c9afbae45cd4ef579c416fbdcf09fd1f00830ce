I"I<p>Tonight was the last meeting of the club year.</p>

<p>Our topic for the evening was ‘Composition’. We’ve dealt with this topic on a number of occasions, however, this evening took a different format. Two video’s were shown, each one presenting a different aspect of ‘Composition’.</p>

<p>The first was ‘side lighting’ and how to enhance the main subject of the image. Of about 10 minutes in length the presentation showed how to use ‘side lighting’ to the best dramatic effect. Using a rather bland image of a tree as the initial subject the presenter showed how by  ‘Lightroom’ it is possible to create a stunning photograph by the use of a very few alteration techniques.
The second video concentrated on ‘low light’ and ‘evening photography’. Again, of about 10 minutes in length, the video provided aspects of evening lighting in a variety ways. By changing just a few controls totally different images can be produced.</p>

<p>Although ‘Lightroom’ was used to make the changes to each image it was emphasised that any software would provide any of the changes required.
A short discussion followed each video.</p>

<p>The club has a number of video’s showing a range of techniques in photography that will be shown over the forthcoming months.</p>
