I"¶<p>This monthâ€™s topic was on â€˜Back Button Focusâ€™.</p>

<p>Back Button Focus - or Focus Lock - is a little used (and may I say, understood) facility on most modern camerasâ€™. We therefore had a short presentation of the function; when to use it and how it works. The presentation was followed by a short practice session. For those that didnâ€™t bring their camera please check your camera manual for how to locate the feature.</p>

<p><strong>AOB -</strong>
The chairman of the â€œ1940â€™s Eventâ€ at Ironbridge Park over the Bank Holiday at the end of May 2018, has advised us that could have an area of the â€˜Entertainmentâ€™ marquee provided we can ensure the safety of the public. Doing this would mean that we would be covered by their â€˜Public Liability Insuranceâ€™. It was agreed that we would take up the offer and Joan is to check the details with the chairman of the event organisers. We need volunteers to attend to the clubs display over the two days of the event which takes place on the 26th and 27th May. Volunteers will be briefed beforehand into the function of the â€˜displayâ€™. If anyone has any photographs they would like to be used on the display would they please bring them to the clubs meeting on 21st May at the Birchmeadow Centre.</p>
