I"Ä<p>This year‚Äôs program has a mixture of Workshops and Focus points, you should definitely bring along your camera to every meeting. There are a varied range of aspects and techniques to practise. We are again setting out the entire Year‚Äôs Competitions. That is for both Monthly and Quarterly, plenty of time to practise.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll also notice that this does seem to be a very long season. And yes that is correct. The aim of this ‚Äòextended‚Äô season is to bring the club‚Äôs programme in-line with the AGM/Financial year end etc.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Open Session</strong> ‚Äì here is no competition with this meeting, we want you to bring along 2 of your best photos, so we can see what you like to photograph, as well as having a discussion on how and why you took them. This can be anything you want, and edited how you want.</p>

<ul>
  <li>31st October 2016</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Image Sharpness</strong> ‚Äì We will be having a discussion on how to find the ‚ÄòSweet Spot‚Äô on your lens to get the sharpest results. We‚Äôll talk about a rule of thumb, and how to test this out yourself. Bring your Cameras and we‚Äôll give it a go as well.</p>

<ul>

<p><strong>Guest Speaker</strong> ‚Äì We have arranged for Van Greaves FRPS to provide us with a talk. Van has several books of photographs published that include ‚ÄúMoods of Shropshire &amp; The Marches‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorcestershire &amp; Elgar Country‚Äù. It is understood that he will make an ‚ÄòAudio Visual‚Äô presentation of about 30 to 40 minutes followed by a Q &amp; A session.</p>

<ul>
  <li>30th January 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Photoshop Demo</strong> ‚Äì We will be taking another look with a software demo for one tool in particular. For this demo we will concentrate on ‚ÄòCloning‚Äô and how to tidy up your images if you feel the need to.</p>

<ul>
  <li>27th February 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Seeing the Light</strong> ‚Äì Ever looked what light source will be lighting your image and where it‚Äôs coming from? This is something everyone should consider before pressing the shutter. We will be discussing light in general to help you decide composition and image angle.</p>

<ul>
  <li>27th March 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shutter Speed</strong> ‚Äì TBring your cameras to this workshop. We will be discussing shutter speed in general, as well as what to look for before setting your speed and what to be aware of to eliminate and reduce image blurring.</p>

<ul>
  <li>24th April 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your Photographic Mind</strong> ‚Äì To make an image stand out, you really have to think before hitting the shutter button. We will be going through a mental check list that you should go through to help make your snapshots in to amazing images.</p>

<ul>
  <li>22nd May 2017 (due to Bank Holiday).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fill The Frame</strong> ‚Äì Another important composition rule that we don‚Äôt tend to see a lot of. Our discussion will cover why and when you should fill the frame, as well as another reminder on cropping in post.</p>

<ul>
  <li>26th June 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TRIP OUT - Bridgnorth</strong> ‚Äì Hopefully the weather will hold out, and we‚Äôll have nice sunshine. This is a casual walk around Bridgnorth where you can take the opportunity to take images of what ever you‚Äôd like, but feel free to ask any questions regarding your camera, settings and composition etc to a member of the committee.</p>

<ul>
  <li>31st July 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Panoramic</strong>‚Äì This discussion speaks for itself. BUT do bring your camera, you will be snapping away in the evening, and going home to stitch together.</p>

<ul>
  <li>25th September 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Composition</strong>‚Äì We have had several presentations on this in the past, so this is more of a refresher and helpful hints of new comers. Delving into possibly one or two in a little more depth. As well as discussing the use of Cropping in post edits to achieve better images.</p>

<ul>
  <li>30th October 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Portraits</strong>‚Äì Back by popular demand, we will hopefully arrange a couple of models for us to photograph, but prior to this, we will have a brief discussion on posing, including ideas for groups. We‚Äôll also briefly discuss reflectors and off camera flash.</p>

<ul>
  <li>27th November 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Open Session</strong>‚Äì We will be having another ‚ÄòOpen Night‚Äô where members are asked to bring along 2 of their best images, whatever you want, edited how you like. This time we will use this as an additional competition - and spend time talking about their images.</p>

<ul>
  <li>29th January 2018</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Water Droplets</strong>‚Äì We will be showing you the basic equipment you‚Äôll need to set up your own mini studio to photograph water droplets. The images taken will be shown - warts ‚Äôn all, so you can see that these things take time and practice. We‚Äôll also get a few of you to have a go.</p>
