A filled programme for this season. There are plenty of chances to dust off the camera gear and test out some of our theories. Focus Points will still continue, and we will be trying to organise more trips this year, in fact there is one instead of our meeting to encourage you to get out and about with us and your fellow members. We look forward to seeing you all there.
