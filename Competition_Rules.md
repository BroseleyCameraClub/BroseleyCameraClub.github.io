<br/>
The competitions are held to encourage members to 'get out and about'. Submissions, therefore, should preferably be recent, although not mandatory.

A floating cup will be awarded annually to the person gaining the most points in the period of the season (January to November) at the Clubs AGM meeting in January.

<br>

#### Monthly Competition

<br>
Monthly Competition entries will be rectangular in shape, and 'up to' but no larger than 7&quot;x5&quot;. If the image is submitted as 7&quot;x5&quot;, it should be mounted in mounts provided by Broseley Camera Club. 

Competition Titles can be found in the current programme lists.

Two free mounts are provided, any more can be purchased from Broseley Camera Club.

The image title should be presented clearly at the base of the mount.

It is also optional to write the camera settings on the back of the entry to aid with the 'Critique Session' at the end of each meeting.

<br>

#### Quarterly Competition

<br>
Quarterly Competition entries will be rectangular in shape, and 'up to' but no larger than A4. These entries do not need to be mounted.

Competition Titles can be found in the current programme lists.

The image title should be presented clearly at the base of the mount.

It is also optional to write the camera settings on the back of the entry to aid with the 'Critique Session' at the end of each meeting.
