We all like a day on the beach now and again so this evening we discussed *Beach Scenes*. From images of sandy beaches to rocky shorelines and angry seas our presentation provided details of how to produce them all. 

>Before taking any pictures, in what could be dangerous situations, your safe location must be your first concern. 

It was recommended that you reconnoitre your chosen site before taking any photographs. Long and short exposure images also with dawn and sunset pictures were shown in a slide show to provide some idea of the type of image that can be produced. If taking photographs on well lit sandy beaches remember that the sand causes the same ‘problems’ with respect to exposure as snowy scenes.
