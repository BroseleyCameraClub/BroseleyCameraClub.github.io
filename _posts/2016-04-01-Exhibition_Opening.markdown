#### Black and White

<br>
Our members have submitted some of their best black and white images for this exhibition, showing off the high level of skills within such a small club.

Club Chairman Graham Welsby stated...

<blockquote>I rarely get asked why to shoot in black and white, but when to shoot in black and white and I find that fascinating.</blockquote>


There are many reasons to use Black and White, here are a few points...

<ul>
	<li>You see light in a different way, without the colours distracting from the subject.</li>
	<li>Emotions of the image can be emphasised more simply.</li>
	<li>And there is somewhat of a classic, timeless feel to black and white.</li>
</ul>

We discuss these aspects and more in detail in some of our "Focus Point Presentations" in club meetings.

The exhibition will run from the <b>1st April - 30th June 2016</b> at the <a href="http://www.birchmeadow.org.uk/" alt="Birchmeadow Center Website" target="_blank">Birchmeadow Center</a> in Broseley. Everyone is welcome to view the images on display, although it would be a good idea to check if the Birch Meadow Center is open on the day your looking to come along.

We will be adding an Exhibition Gallery to our website, however, this will not be until the exhibition is over.
