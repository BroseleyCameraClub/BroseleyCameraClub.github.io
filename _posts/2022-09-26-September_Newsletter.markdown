An old faithful for us in discussing tips of Black and White.

We discussed some tips to looking differently at how you think about black and white photography. Different aspects of composition, taking your images in colour and amending to black and white, and most importantly, changing your 'best' images to black and white as just changing a poor image to black and white won't save or make it better.

Full details of this will be in the members newsletter.
