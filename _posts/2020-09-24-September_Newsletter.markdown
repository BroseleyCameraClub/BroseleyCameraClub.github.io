We had a further discussion regarding how we will conduct future meetings and currently until Jan 2021, we will be holding all meetings on Zoom as per the last several months. I hope that this is OK, as I know that a few can't wait to get back to the normal Face to Face meetings, however we do need to try to safeguard our members.
