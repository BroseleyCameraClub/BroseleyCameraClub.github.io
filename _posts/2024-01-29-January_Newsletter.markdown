First meeting of the new season/year, and we had a good number of new members. All were welcomed and introduced.

As ever the first meeting holds the AGM, where we discuss the new season, the last season and the results from the previous year's competitons were announced.

AGM Notes are only passed to subscribed members.

#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Movement*. 

This year we are looking at genres of photography, and more general rather than drilling into the specifics. We went through several movement types of photography, and discussed some at length, and as usual we critiqued some random images from the web.
