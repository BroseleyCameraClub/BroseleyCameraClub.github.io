This evening’s topics were predominately Sport and Movement. Involving, mainly, how to capture movement with and without blur. A number of images were shown providing details of indoor and outdoor techniques including artificial lighting to arrest the action. A brief discussion followed on how we may replicate the images shown.

A ‘YouTube’ video was then shown on landscape photography and the use of light in differing situations and at various times of year.

You can view that video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93Ulna1lVfI">HERE</a> or watch below.

If you enjoyed the video by Thomas Heaton, you can see his channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfhW84xfA6gEc4hDK90rR1Q">HERE</a>. I think you'll find this a very useful site to get some tips and tricks for Landscape Photography.
