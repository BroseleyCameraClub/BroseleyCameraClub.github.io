The months Focus Point was *'Fire, Flames and Combustibles'*. We had a short discussion on what we would of been doing, that to be honest, we were terribly upset that we couldn't do what we really wanted to do, which was to hire a performer and take some amazing photos. Unfortunately due to our current situation we were still on line and going through the theory, although we watched a short video on photographing wire wool.

With our new 'on line' format, this is allowing members to enter without having to attend. However, this can give some members vote advantages if they enter and don't vote.

So in the spirit of the club, we do ask that if you made the effort to take the photos, edit them - nurture them into masterpieces and emailing them to enter, please make the effort to vote - it is only fair on your fellow members.
