For the first time in the history of the club we had a guest speaker. 

:: STEVE ELLIOTT ::

The local photographer was kind enough to provide us with some of his time and expertise.

Initially Steve showed a few images of various quality and contend, asking the members what they liked and wanted to know. The main image of interest was a very unusual wedding photograph to which Steve explained the details and thoughts behind the content of the image. He then went on to show and discuss some nighttime photographs he'd taken.

Following the discussion about the photographs Steve gave us an abridged history of how he got into photography - particularly corporate event and live-band photography.

The very interesting talk lasted for about an hour - many thanks to Steve for his time and contribution. If anyone wants to see Steve's work or to contact him, he is available on steveelliottimages.co.uk
