description: news from our July 2017 Meeting.
---
Tonight was the last meeting of the club year.

Our main topic for the evening was ‘Panorama’. To get the best of the technique is to ‘stitch’ a number of images together with photo-manipulation software. In order for the software to do this properly care should be taken in photographing the subject. Approx’ one third of the images used should overlap each other. Consider the time of day and location as well as the subject as this will also affect the final composition of the proposed image. It is also strongly recommended that a tripod (or other stable resting place for the camera) be used. It was emphasised the ‘Panoramas’’ can be vertical as well as horizontal. 

A number of images were shown of our visits to Bridgnorth and the ‘Black Country Living Museum’. They indicated the different ways our members see and compose their pictures for there own entertainment rather than the needs and restrictions of our competitions.
