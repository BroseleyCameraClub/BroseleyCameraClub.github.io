It has been on the list of programme topics from a few years now to get a guest speaker in to discuss their images.

I'm please to say that we have finally got around to doing just that. The November meeting, we are happy to anounce that we have a local Photographer - Steve Elliot.

Please vew his work here at <a href=" http://www.steveelliottimages.co.uk">Steve Elliott Images</a>. Steve will be presenting some of his portfolio images and discussing the settings used and why he chose them. 

We hope you enjoy the presentation, Steve has also offered to stay for a while now, so he will be able to offer some critique on some of the competition entries also. So if you'd like some pro advise, please bring along your images and enter the latest comp.

See you November 30th 2015.
