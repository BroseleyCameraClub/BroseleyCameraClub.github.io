A different format for the evenings activities, and an ‘Open Session’ was up for discussion. No competitions were to be held, instead those members present were asked to show a couple of images and explain why and, if possible, how the photographs were taken. 

The emphasis of the evening was to find out what type of images are preferred by the photographers, as well as a learning exercise for all who attended.
All got off to a slow start, with no volunteers coming forward with John Horton stepping forward to explained his preferred photographic subject and why. Having ‘broken the ice’, every member took the floor to present their images in turn. The discussion also included the equipment i.e. camera and, when known, lens used.

Although techniques were mentioned it seems that we still need to repeat some features of photography for anyone new to the process, composition being the main concern.

There were no competitions this month.
