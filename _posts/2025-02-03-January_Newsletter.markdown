Very Short introduction to a free and easy evening. A few nibbles to mark the last meeting of the season, a little social discussions, quick run though a few ideas for the programme 2025. 

We ran through the monthly competition, and proceeded to announce the winners for the seasons monthly and quarterly competitions.

<!-- #### Presentation

<br>

The presentation about *'Fashion, Portraits & Closeups'* was held. We discussed a few tips around this genre, and how you can look into lots of ways to use this yourself with your own images.

Some amazing images were critiqued and reviewed, and discussions around a few videos that you could review.
