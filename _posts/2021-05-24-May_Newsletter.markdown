description: news from our May 2021 Meeting.

After a bit of a chat and putting the world to rights on the current and every changing situation, we proceeded with the normal presentation - Streams and Rivers...

We discussed several items that you should consider when thinking about streams and rivers... in short these are...

<ul>
	<li>Planning - you must plan your trip as the weather can change, sun rise/set can happen very quickly, so scouting out the area for compositions is essential</li>
	<li>Equipment - apart from your camera and lens, a tripod is helpful, as well as waders and general water proof clothing.</li>
	<li>Filters - some good filters can help also, not only graduated filters for the sun, but a polarizing filter can be super helpful.</li>
	<li>Safety - obviously this one goes without saying. If you are going to be venturing around the water, or even braving going in, please please be very careful as this can be extremely dangerous. Your safety is paramount before any mishaps with equipment.</li>
</ul>

These are only a few items that we discussed before proceeding through the competition results.

We watched a couple of video's that I thought would be helpful... these will be linked in the membership news letter.
