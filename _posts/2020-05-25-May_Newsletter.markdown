Another online presentation and a very good number of members logged on. Some unfortunately suffering poor connection - there is a fair bit going around hopefully the ISP's can get things better.

We had a discussion regarding the competition layouts and if members liked the revised format, it was well received and the two different viewing styles help members look in more detail, as well as looking at the new table view to see which images stand out.  Obviously - if you have any ideas please let me know.

Again we discussed the future of the meetings, and with the slight relax in lock down measures, things may change in the next few months. However, it was decided that we will be having June's meeting online regardless.

July - we will play by ear, however it looks like it may be September where we will meet back in the Birchmeadow. However we will still be continuing the online format for the foreseeable future.
