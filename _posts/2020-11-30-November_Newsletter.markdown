description: news from our November 2020 Meeting.

The months Focus Point was *'Oil &amp; Water'*. The presentation we looked at covered the basics of how to get going. Covering some very basic equipment, and some basic to more extensive set ups.
 
 A pretty good response was had by all, hopefully everyone will try it out over the next few months until we meet again in the new year.

*Members receive a copy of the presentation in the club newsletter.*

With our new 'on line' format, this is allowing members to enter without having to attend. However, this can give some members vote advantages if they enter and don't vote.

So in the spirit of the club, we do ask that if you made the effort to take the photos, edit them - nurture them into masterpieces and emailing them to enter, please make the effort to vote - it is only fair on your fellow members.
