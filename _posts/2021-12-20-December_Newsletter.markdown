title:  New Programme for 2022 Season

description: news of our 2022 season.

With 2021 quickly coming to a close, we have been working hard to put together the programme for the 2022 season.

Unfortunately we are still looking at continuing the club meetings on Zoom. This decision is difficult to make, as we know that you are all looking forward to some normality and face to face meetings are preferable. However, having a wide range of members in different situation, we do need to ensure that all our members are safeguarded. And we hope that the situation changes soon. As evr, we are keeping a close eye on the local/national figures and current government advice and will notify the members of any changes when they happen.

In the meantime, please have a read of our new season's programme clicking <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/programme/2020-12-16-Forward-Programme-2022">HERE</a>

There is a good range of presentations, of which we are returning to some months where the competitions will follow the theme from the *Focus Points*. Give you some good practice from our discussions. There is also plenty of opportunity for you to use these *Focus Points* in your every day photography.
