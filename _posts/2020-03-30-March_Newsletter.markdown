description: news from our March 2020 Meeting.
---

Well with the current situation in the country, we had to change the format of our usual face-to-face meetings to our video conference.

Members were asked to submit their images via email for the competition, these were up and viewable for members to view on the website, and a simple voting system was set up.

The meeting it's self was relatively simple and it was a great turn out for both the competition and the meeting. A few technical issues at the start for some, but once we talked those guys through, they were on line and ready.

The presentation on the evening was 'Macro Photography'. Where techniques and equipment were discussed.

*Members receive a copy of the presentation in the club newsletter.*

Again with the unfortunate current situation, it was discussed that we will still have our April meeting on-line, and possibly the May meeting also, and then we will need to assess and monitor where we are up to around that time.

Unfortunately we will need to postpone the June trip to Birmingham, a date will be set later in the year - again this will depend on the virus details
