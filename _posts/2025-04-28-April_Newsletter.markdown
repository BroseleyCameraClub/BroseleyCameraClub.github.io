#### Presentation

<br>

The presentation from *'Garry Jones'* was held.

A guest speaker for us this month. Garry kindly offered to talk us through his trip to Vietnam. This was a very enjoyable presentation where we discussed aspects of the trip as well as why he took certain images and what he was looking for whilst touring around certain areas.

These were some good conversations, and certainly illustrated to members why and how images are worked for, and sometimes they fall into your lap. However it definitely answered the question that you are always looking for the next photograph.
