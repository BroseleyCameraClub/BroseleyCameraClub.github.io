description: news from our March 2016 Meeting.
---

Due to the previous bank holiday - we held the meeting a week later than our usual day.

Our main topic for the night was 'Framing of the subject'. This wasn't a demonstration on how to make a wooden frame, nor how to make a custom mount. This was a discussion on how to use objects to create a frame for your subjects, create a little more interest in your images with blurred foreground objects, architectural, natural, and other such items.

Following the presentation, we opened the exhibition, where members and guests could move through to the 'Bar' area to view the submitted images. I would like to add here a personal Thanks to all of you who submitted images. I have to say once again the level of quality has been stepped up again. I think that this is certainly one of our best exhibitions to date. I would love to hear some feedback on your thoughts.
