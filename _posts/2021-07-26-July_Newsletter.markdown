Out last meeting before the summer break, and we ended the months Focus Point was 'Portraiture Photography'. 

We discussed a few different aspects, and some tips and tricks regarding this topic, however, the techniques we went through can be used in other aspects and subjects of photography. Lighting, Composition - all are vital to use all the time to create stunning images.

The presentation held some interesting tips as well as a few brief views of some videos to catch. Links were sent out with the newsletter.
