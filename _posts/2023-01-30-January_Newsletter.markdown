First meeting back from teh Christmas holiday, and started things off with the AGM.

__Membership fees.__ Unfortunately due to the rent of the room going up we have had to push the increase onto the membership fees, this means the fee is now £20/year . These should of been paid on the night, however, if you havent' attended, or forgot your cash, an email will be sent out with details on how to pay digitally.

__Website updates.__  We are still looking for membership galleries for updates. You can now add up to 9 images in your own area. If you wish to resend and update all the images, or just top up to the 9, please email them to Graham so we can add them in.

__Images of note.__ The committee this year have all picked images of note. These are images that may not of had a placement, but were outstanding in their own right. these were as follows...
