#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Documentary Photography*. 

We took a different approach to this genre. Discussion on how you can use different techniques of Documentary photography in your daily lives. It's not all about the historic images that you may of thought, but how you can document history of your own lives and memories.
