Quick discussion on the months events, and other such items,

#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Travel Photography*. 

We discussed that a review of all the previous presentations to look forward to Travel Photography. Composition is vitally important, and looking through all the previous techniques to bring together all elements to have success in this genre. A very interesting take, and great to see so many members remembered lots of the tips and techniques discussed over the last several months.
