Welcome back for another season of photographic exploration and experimentation. This years programme covers a multitude of styles, techniques and genre – for full details please see the club web-site.
This evening we were “Using Window Light”. A brief presentation was given on how to set up and achieve side lighting with and without reflectors. 

Joan Banks won both the Monthly and Quarterly Cups. Well done Joan.

Thank you to all those members that provided ideas for the programme of events and competitions for the forthcoming year.

As we shall be conducting a number of ‘workshops’, it is strongly recommended that you bring your camera with you when attending the meetings this year.

After the competitions we asked that alternative photographs to be brought and if time allows we shall discuss them. By alternative photographs we mean those images which you thought of entering into the months competition but decided not to for whatever reason.
Should anyone have any extra photographs (including your disasters) that they would like to be assessed please bring it/them along. If we have time we’ll definitely appraise the image(s).

More entries are required for the Members Gallery of the club web-site. Please forward your images for the club Gallery directly to Graham.
