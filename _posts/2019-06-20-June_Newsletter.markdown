Off camera flash” was the topic for this evening’s presentation. Along with a discussion about the techniques and apparatus used in “Off camera flash” –  inc’ flash-guns, remote sensors and reflectors – a brief workshop was held on the playing fields adjacent to the Birchmeadow Centre. The technique lends itself particularly well to portraiture as was demonstrated during the presentation.
