Good to get through a few chats about the potential club outings this year. A few were sounding good, and everyone sounded positive about getting out and about to work on their techniques and photography skills.

#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Weather*. 

Continuing with this years theme of genres of photography, the focus point was on weather and different types. Mainly we concentrated on Lightning and Storms, but there are plenty of opportunity to practice in the UK, specifically rain. However, it was interesting to look through the tips of getting out and about, safely as possible due to the obvious dangers.
