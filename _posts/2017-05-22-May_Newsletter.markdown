Our primary topic for the evening was “Filling the Frame”. A brief presentation and discussion was held, and for those who remembered their cameras, we popped outside to take a few shots practicing the techniques discussed.


The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled 'Flora & Fauna' was held.

The winners were:-

<ul>
	<li>1st - 'My Beady Eye' by Dianne Pickett</li>
	<li>2nd - 'Holte on a minute' by John Horton</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Tulip' by Trevor Rowley</li>
</ul>

#### _CLUB OUTING_
<br>	
Each year, we try to get out and about during the club meeting. For those who attended the May meeting got the chance to vote on all the suggestions that were made. The next club meeting will be a walk about Bridgnorth. We will be meeting at the Northgate at 7pm, and going on from there. Please __DO NOT__ forget your camera.

We also voted to have a weekend trip also. Due to the number of failures of none attendance or interest, you will need to make your own way there. The vote will take us to the Black Country Museum (Click <a href="https://www.bclm.co.uk/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to visit the website). A time and date will be sent out to all members.

<br>

### NEXT MEETING
<br>

Our meeting is a walk about around Bridgnorth. Meeting 26th June 2017 at the Northgate 7pm please. We will have the competition somewhere after the walk around - Venue TBA.
