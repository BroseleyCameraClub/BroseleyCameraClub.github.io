Tonight’s presentation was on the topic of High Key and Low Key Photography. These techniques are primarily a method of introducing drama and emotion into a photograph.

High Key - Lots of light and generally used in portraiture of women. It introduces a ‘soft’ edge to the subject. Though normally produced in a studio environment it can be used outside with a large aperture setting and lots of back lighting.

Low Key - Low levels of light picking up the highlights of the subject. Generally used in portraiture of men – especially men with ‘craggy contours’. Dark, moody, sinister scenes can be produced using this technique.


_Presentations are available for download for members._

### NEXT MEETING
<br>

We are **NOT** meeting at the Birchmeadow for our next meeting. We have our summer outing and are visiting Ironbridge. Meeting is still on for 7:30pm, meeting at the War Memorial by the Bridge. We will have a walk about, giving members a chance to ask questions from committee members about particular issues they may have with their cameras and photography. 

Nearest parking situated to the meeting spot is <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Ironbridge+Coach+Park/@52.6264369,-2.4856584,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48707edb841356d9:0xb9d7f295c647d97d!8m2!3d52.6264337!4d-2.4834644?hl=en" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
