With the weather closing in and the darker nights are already here, we were back in for a focus point/discussion around the evenings topic of *Engineering*.

We welcomed some new members to the evening, introductions were made, and we discussed our normal processes for an evenings focus point.

#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Engineering*. 

There are several ways to look at the genre of 'Engineering' and we explored a few of them, from close ups, wider shots, the architecture from amazing engineering, but also looking at the stories, creating atmosphere with lighting, and of course the people in the field of work.

There are great action shots to be had with this genre, and using light and composition to your advantage is definitely something you should consider.
