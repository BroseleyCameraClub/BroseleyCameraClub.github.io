description: news from our June 2021 Meeting.
---

Much debate on what is happening with the Covid Situation, and unfortunately, we are in the hands of the Birch. Although things do seem to opening up - I'm sure that we all have an opinion if it is too much too soon - but a soon as we are allowed to return to face to face meetings, we will let you know. But as ever we will obviously discuss it with the members on how and what we will be doing.

Our focus point for the evening was around - Architecture Photography.
We discussed some of the tips and tricks that advanced and professional photographers use to improve you images, and then broke all the rules with 6 further rules that just looked more fun.

Once again, the presentation is available to download with the newsletter, as well as all the links to the videos and images.
