After welcoming our two new members, we quickly moved onto the topic for the evening – Photo Editing.

Using ‘Photoshop’ as the software for the presentation a display in how to use the ‘Clone’ tool was shown. The features failings as well as its benefits were shown along with ways to adjust the final image. Although ‘Photoshop’ was used, the ‘Clone’ feature is common to all photo-manipulation software and no matter which product is used the processes are basically similar.

As we had two competitions this evening the remainder of the session was spent in assessing, voting and commenting on the entries.

The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled 'Objects From the Shed' was held.

The winners were:-

<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Over-Wintering' by Joan Banks</li>
	<li>2nd - 'An Old Tool-Box' by John Horton</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Dust &amp; Cobwebs' by Jan Lancaster</li>
</ul>
