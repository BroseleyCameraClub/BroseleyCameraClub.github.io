description: news from our November 2022 Meeting.

Following our theme throughout the year we looked at some composition techniques that you may not of tried before, but a little bit of study and practice, will help you increase your skill levels and enhance your images. In particular we discussed Symmetry and Negative Space. 

This was a short presentation, but there are some crossovers in both techniques, as well as cross overs of other techniques. These were discussed to some lenght, but discussions on other images were used for longer critiques.

Full details of this will be in the members newsletter.
