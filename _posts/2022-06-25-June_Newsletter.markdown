A new 'Focus Point' to the clubs programme, with a subject of - How to Improve Your Composition by Adding a Focal Point.

Composition is a subject we discuss frequently. But it is a subject that a lot of photographers find difficult to master - but when they do, this is one of the most powerful skills in a photographers bag of tricks.

We discussed this in length, narrowing down a few ideas on how to make your subject the focal point of the image. Depth of field, zooming in closer to the subject and isolated subjects were a few ideas amongst many more...

There were many more items discussed to inspire you to photograph.

Full details of this will be in the members newsletter.
