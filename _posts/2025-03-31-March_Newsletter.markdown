#### Presentation

<br>

The presentation about *'Negative Space'* was held.

We discussed several things to consider around negative space, these included...

<ul>
 <li><i>Emphasises the subject</i></li>
 	<ul>
		<li>Negative space draws attention to the main subject by reducing distractions.</li>
	</ul>
 <li><i>Creating a sense of Scale</i></li>
	<ul>
		<li>It can make a subject appear larger or smaller by showing how much empty space surrounds it </li>
	</ul>
 <li><i>Minimalist</i></li>
	<ul>
		<li>Negative space promotes a clean, simple, and uncluttered composition, often leading to a stronger visual impact.</li>
	</ul>
 <li><i>Elicits Emotion</i></li>
	<ul>
		<li>A vast amount of empty space can evoke feelings of isolation, loneliness, peace, or contemplation.</li>
	</ul>
 <li><i>And More...</i></li>
</ul>
