Do any of your photographs have a bluish or orangey hue to them? This may be due to your camera having the wrong "White Balance" setting.

"White Balance" was therefore the topic presented during the evening.

Every light source has its own 'colour temperature' signature. In fact the Sun's 'colour temperature' changes throughout the course of the day and is also affected by the weather conditions. It is this 'colour temperature' that dictates the hue of our images, ranging from red - cool - to blue - hot. Every digital camera is initially set to an automatic 'white balance' setting where it assesses the 'colour temperature' of the subject being taken. Very often the assessment is satisfactory but not in all cases. That is why most camera's have various 'white balance' setting that may be adjusted by the photographer. As a cloudy day offers a different 'colour temperature' to that of bright sunlight the changing of the appropriate setting may be necessary and is made quite easily. The manual of your camera will tell you how (and why) to make the appropriate adjustment. "YouTube" contains several tutorials about "white balance" and anyone interested in the topic are recommended to view one or more of the tutorials.

Some camera's may also provide the facility of the user being able to tailor their "white balance" individually with the use of a mid-grey card and/or a "white balance' gauze that can be attached to the front of the camera lens. Should you wish to do this please check the details in your camera's manual.
