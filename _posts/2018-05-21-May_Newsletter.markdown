First and foremost - You have probably received several emails lately about the GDPR. This is because of a law that came into effect on 25th May 2018. This law also covers our club, however, the only data we hold are your names, addresses, telephone/mobile numbers and email addresses. As a consequence of the new regulations we need your agreement to send unsolicited emails. If you wish to be sent club emails you need do nothing, as the present system will continue to exist. If, on the other hand, you do not want any further correspondence would you please contact either myself or Graham (our email addresses are on the clubs web-site) requesting to be removed from the automated system.

This month’s topic was on <i>‘The Sea’</i>.

We watched several videos illustrating the different methods and tips and tricks to think about when photographing seascapes.

As stated previously, you can find a whole load of tutorial videos on this subject as well as a load of other photography subjects on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>.

A briefing about the “1940’s Event” at Dale End Park over the Bank Holiday at the end of May 2018, was given. Thank you to all the volunteers that attended the event. Some of Graham’s and my photographs can be seen on our ‘Flickr’ accounts. 

Another reminder that we still need members images for the Gallery section of our web site. About 6 images of any genre if you could. The member will be credited and shall maintain the copyright. Please don’t miss the opportunity to show how good you are. Send your images to either the Chairman or Secretary for inclusion on the site. A few members have kindly sent some images for the Gallery to Graham. However, a few more would be appreciated.

Should anyone be interested, a photo opportunity is being provided by English Heritage on the 9th and 10th June. The organisation is holding a ‘Battle’ between two groups of Roman re-enactor at Viroconium (Wroxeter), the event is open to the public and an entrance fee will be levied. More details are available on the English Heritage web-site.
