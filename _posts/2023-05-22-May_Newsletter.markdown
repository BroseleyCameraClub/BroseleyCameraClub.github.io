After our usual greeting chats, we tried out a slightly different format. 
<br>

<hr>

<br>

#### Presentation

<br>

The evenings presentation was on *Recreation Around Water*. Instead of the usual presentation, we ran through quite a few images where, as a group, we decided on possible settings used by the photographer, possible equipment used, and then a critique on the images presented.

This seemed to go well and great to see that everyone had been paying attention to the last several months of presentations and that we felt as a group that we had pretty much got to grips with the techniques, and applied the knowledge that we'd aquired and think that we could of improved quite a few of the imgages.
