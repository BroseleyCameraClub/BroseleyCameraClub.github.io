#### Presentation

<br>

The evenings presentation was on *Costal Photography* (Piers / Arcades / People / Wildlife). This was a presentation on other items to look for. Don't just walk around and take the same images as other people, or holiday snappers. Scout out the area, look for different or better angles than the ones that are obvious.

Tips on composition, essential equipment to use, time of day were discussed. All of which as usual you can use, or ignore. But we always advise to at least give these tips a go.

Two competitions were open this month.

Full details of this will be in the members newsletter.
