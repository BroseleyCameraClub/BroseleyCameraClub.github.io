**We are changing the Membership Fees**

We have debated about these changes within the committee for many years now, taking into account various reasons to change or not change. However we feel that this is a good a time as any to implement these for the new 2018-2019 season.

These fees will now include an annual Membership fee of __£15__.

There will *still* be a monthly charge to attending members... however this will be reduced to __50p__ per meeting to cover the costs of Coffee/Tea.

This will be starting as of the Feb meeting (25th February 2018).
