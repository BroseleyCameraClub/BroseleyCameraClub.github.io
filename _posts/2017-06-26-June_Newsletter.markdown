description: news from our June 2017 Meeting.
---
This month we held our annual visit to Bridgnorth. Initially the group visited the area around St Leonards Church before splitting up and going to various parts of the high town.

We all met up in the Stable Bar of the Kings Head in Whitburn St, Bridgnorth, to compare our impressions of the evening.

We hope you all enjoyed the little walk, the sky wasn't much to write home about, but at least it didn't rain.

The monthly competition was also held in the Stable Bar. I’d like to thank the management and staff of the Kings Head for providing the room free-of-charge.

Although the subject was very loosely interpreted by some members, we had a very good range of entries and interpretations of the subject this month and almost everyone obtained at least one vote. 

The ‘Monthly Competition’ entitled 'Abandoned Buildings' was held.

The winners were:-

<ul>
	<li>1st - 'Gravely under Maintained' by John Horton</li>
	<li>2nd - 'Roof Light' by Trevor Rowley</li>
	<li>3rd - 'Underneath the Arches' by Joan Banks</li>
</ul>
