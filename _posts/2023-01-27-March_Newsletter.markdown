The monthly meetings are becoming much more normal. The social side of our club was great to see, we had a great chat about the weather, other clubs, amongst other things.

We quickly got into the months focus point.

#### Presentation

The evenings presentation was on *Concert/Show Photography*, a discussion about different challenges you may face should you want to try out this genre of photography. These included the venue it's self, the different lighting challenges you may face, and how to overcome these. 

Slides were given on the several tips, and what to expect. However challenging this may be, it is a type of photography that we think you should try, possibly some smaller venues, like the Eisteddfod.

Full details of this will be in the members newsletter.
