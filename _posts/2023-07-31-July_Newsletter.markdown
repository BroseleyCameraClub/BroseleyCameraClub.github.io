The final meeting before our Summer break, and good to see so many attending. Great discussions about events coming up around the summer months. Some exciting travels on the agenda for some of our members, and we can't wait to hear about them and see the images.

#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Event Photography*. Although we have covered concert photography and to a certain degree these subjects overlap and possibly have a lot in common (and not just the camera). The presentation was short with some scenarios and examples of situations that you may encounter. However these were presented for practical tips for beginners to take some easy ways for them to get going with event photography
