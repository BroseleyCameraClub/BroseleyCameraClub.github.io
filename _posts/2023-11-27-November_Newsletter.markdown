Last meeting for the year and end of the season for 2023. There was a small number of members, but it was great to see those who attended for the completion of the year. Although a relatively short meeting, we are still asking for ideas and requests for next years programme.

#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Interesting Projects for the Xmas holiday*. 

We tried not to make this the list of 'usual suspects' for home projects that we've discussed in length in previous meetings, but make it as interesting as possible. Please take a look at the download and try some of these out. All should help to improve your photography and have a bit of fun at the same time.
