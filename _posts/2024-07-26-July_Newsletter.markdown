Little bit of a different meeting this evening, it was lovely to get out in the sun and take some photos and have more of a practical session. And why not, it was great to see everyone giving it a go. There were a lot of flowers and insects so hopefully everyone got a good amount of images it would be great to see the results.

#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Travel Photography*. 

We discussed that a review of all the previous presentations to look forward to Travel Photography. Composition is vitally important, and looking through all the previous techniques to bring together all elements to have success in this genre. A very interesting take, and great to see so many members remembered lots of the tips and techniques discussed over the last several months. -->
