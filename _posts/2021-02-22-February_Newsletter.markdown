With the vaccine looking like it's going very strong, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and 'In Person' Meetings may be coming back late summer... so not long to go now.

Although as I'm writing this, the weather is sunny and improving all the time, so hopefully it will allow some outside adventures - WHILST maintaining social distancing!!! This lock down is still in effect and we must still abide by the rules. But no one said we can't take a camera on our exercise walk??
