#### Presentation

<br>

The presentation on *'Reflections'* was held.

WE discussed some tips for looking out for reflections, from making your own, going out after rain fall, or even looking at buildings and objects to find reflections outside of the cliche images we all see.

Then a quick trip out into the field behind looking for something to reflect anything. A bottle of water was used to try something different... we are hoping to have a gallery of images to look. Putting the tips into practice was well received, and we should do this more often.
