The plan of getting out and about to take some evening images was scuppered by the weather being horrible. I was hoping that it would of stopped and we could of got out and used some of the puddles and reflections to add some more interest to the images, unfortunately this was not the case.

We decided to stay in the relative warmth of the Birch, and discuss night photography instead, and go through the competitions and have a good old chat. It was a nice and relaxed evening, and we may possibly do this again.

<!-- #### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Woodland Photography*. 

Now this is a subject that can take you down a very, very long rabbit hole (excusing the pun). With that said, this subject is probably the most accessible for all (most) fo our members. A lot of the tips we went over are very much the same for all the other subjects, that is to use your experience and knowledge of shutter speed, aperture for your depth of field. But most importantly... composition. this is always and primarily where we need to start training our photography eye.
