description: news from our April 2021 Meeting.

We did, once again, discuss in person meetings. It does appear that things are opening up pretty quickly now. We need to wait for the Birch to give us the go ahead before we make any decisions. But September after our Summer break does still seem to be on the cards.

It has not been set up so members can enter the meeting to have a chat before the host starts the zoom meeting, should you have any issues with this please let me know and we will take a look for you.
