#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Landscapes. Seascapes, Cityscapes*. 

A few genres rolled into one presentation in the evening. The main part of this was to concentrate on composition rules, it was discussed and highly recomended that members research all the techniques discussed. Learning about the rules of composition is a great way to imporve your photography, and before you can break the rules, you need to know what they are. 

There are a lot of rules that members are using without realising and they are natural and easy on the human eye, but it is still useful to learn and be mindful of, so you can look for these to add features or increase the level and appeal of your photos.
