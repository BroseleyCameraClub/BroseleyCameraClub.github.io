July's meeting was a good one, with so many great suggestions for next years programme, and competitions we could hold.

The months Focus Point was *'Interior Lighting'*. We discussed possible pit falls of different types of lights, and how to combat against those, and tips and trick to deal with ever changing settings whilst moving from room to room. Plus tricks to adjust in post. This subject had several areas that could easily be used as separate focus points, and members were asked to consider if there was any aspect that they would like to explore in more detail.

*Members receive a copy of the presentation in the club newsletter.*

Discussions on how the future of the club will look like were held again after the questionnaire was submitted, and we look like we are split on a 50/50 on return to staying on-line. We will however need to have further discussions with the Birch, and see if we are able to have the larger hall, and what measures and risk assessments have been made.
