Our AGM was a little shorter than normal, with the Chairman's recap on the last year, including being one of a very small number of clubs that didn't stop for the pandemic and continued to offer content and help to all our members. We discussed membership numbers and costs for the 2021 season, and our financial situation and what we may need to do over the next few years to ensure the club and it's continuation.

The months Focus Point was *'Long Exposure'*. We refreshed our knowledge on settings that effect each other, and what to watch when taking long exposures, as well as equipment that will help you achieve that amazing image.

*Members receive a copy of the presentation in the club newsletter.*
