The chairman welcomed everyone to our meeting and official opening night of the clubs exhibition at 'The Birchmeadow Centre'.

Our main topic for the night was 'Filters'. This was a brief introduction to different types of filter, and their usages, it wasn't meant to be an extensive detailed presentation, you can research this subject on your own, however, it was meant to 'wet your whistle'.

Presentations are available for download for members.
