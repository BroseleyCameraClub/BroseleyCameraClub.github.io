description: news from our September 2019 Meeting.

This evening’s presentation was about streaks of light also called *Light Trails*. These are usually produced in the evening or at night and predominately consist of either traffic or astronomical bodies such as meteor showers or stars. The images are taken of a moving object over a long exposure period thereby creating the trails of light. It is highly recommended that a tripod is used to provide a firm and fixed base for the camera. 

A number of images were shown as examples as too were images of *“painting with light”*. The details of *“painting with light”* were discussed and are – for our purposes – totally different from “light trails”. With “painting with light” the photographer is in control of the light source, whereas with “light trails” they are not.
