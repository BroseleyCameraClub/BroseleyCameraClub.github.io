description: news from our February 2016 Meeting.

The Chairman opened the evening with a short welcoming address and proceeded to explain the running order of the evening’s events. 

The evening was to be rather busy as it contained the club AGM, the monthly competition and a lighting workshop
 

The AGM.

The Treasurer stated that the club is financially sound and consequently the club subscription fee will remain at £1.50 per person per session. Members were asked to provide some idea’s about some equipment we could purchase.

The members of the present committee were returned unopposed.

An exhibition of ‘Monochrome Photography’ has been arranged to take place at the Birchmeadow Centre, Broseley, in the near future. Exhibition open evening is to be held in conjunction with the next meeting.

As the club programme year and the AGM are, for historical reasons, not synchronised it was decided that the two aspects are to be brought into line. The 2016 – 2017 ‘year’ shall be from February 2016 to July 2017. The next AGM will therefore take place in July 2017. The 2017 – 2018 year will start, as usual, in the September.

The ‘Mentorship Scheme’ is to be changed. A questionnaire was given to each member at the meeting. From the answers given each member will be assigned a ‘Mentor’. Should a member have any photographic query or need assistance they are asked to contact their assigned ‘Mentor’ for guidance. Email addresses and ‘phone numbers will be provided as necessary. The details provided by the questionnaire will also help in the production of the 2016 – 2017 programme of events.
