description: news from our March 2018 Meeting.

This month’s topic was an Open Session about 'Exposure'. 

This month saw the return of the photographic triangle of ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed.

For a correct exposure it should be remembered that a change in one of these items necessitates a change in at least one of the others. We also had a quick look at the other settings on the camera including Aperture Priority, Speed Priority and Manual. This was followed by a quick look at the camera’s information screen

It was confirmed that a visit to Chester Zoo will take place. However we need at least 15 confirmed attendees to receive a group discount. Please advise Graham Welsby if you intend to go ASAP. Full details to be confirmed later.

The July meeting shall also be our annual evening out. This year it is to take place at Shrewsbury. Full details shall be posted when known. It is likely that the competition will be held in the backyard of the Admiral Benbow public house.

**AOB -**
We still need to obtain Public Liability Insurance if the club is to have a stand at the “1940’s Event” at Ironbridge Park over the Bank Holiday at the end of May 2018.

Another reminder that we still need members images for the Gallery section of our web site. Up to 6 images of any genre. The member will be credited and shall maintain the copyright. Please don’t miss the opportunity to show how good you are. Send your images to either the Chairman or Secretary for inclusion on the site.
