This evening’s main topic was ‘5 Tips to make more impact with your photography’, or alternatively, '5 Tips to improve your images'. The presentation consisted of a slide show containing a number of advisable details on photographic improvement.

Briefly the tips were as follows:-

<ul>
	<li>Patience</li>
	<li>Critique Your own Work.</li>
	<li>Shoot in the right light.</li>
	<li>Chose your main subject of focus.</li>
	<li>Post Editing Techniques.</li>
	<li>Bonus Tip - Off Camera Flash</li>
</ul>

Members receive a copy of the presentation in the club newsletter.

Although these are quite a wide selection of tips, there is a possibility to go deeper at a future Focus Point.
