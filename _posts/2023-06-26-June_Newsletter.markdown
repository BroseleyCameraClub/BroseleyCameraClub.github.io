We had a great meeting, discussing a subject that we haven't had for some time.
Unfortunately the Birmingham trip was a bit of a wash out, as not many members attended, and the train service was... well, not the most amazing and quite a disappointment.

#### Presentation

<br>

The focus point for the evening was *Silhouettes*. We discussed some tips and things to look out for when trying out this area of photography. It's a great genre of photography that everyone should definitely try, which you will need to for the July competition.
