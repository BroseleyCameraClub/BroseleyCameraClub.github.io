Again we discussed the future of the meetings, and with the slight relax in lock down measures, things may change in the next few months. However, it was decided that we will be having June's meeting online regardless.

July - we will play by ear, however it looks like it may be September where we will meet back in the Birchmeadow. However we will still be continuing the online format for the foreseeable future.
