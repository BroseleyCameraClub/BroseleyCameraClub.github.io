#### Presentation

<br>

The presentation on *'Panning'* was held.

Again this month we had another member give our presentation. Russ delivered a few images he had taken personally and discussed various shutter speeds showing the effects this had on various situations.

He delivered tips on how to take the images, angles to look for, how to hold your camera for the best results as well as some ideal settings to get you going.
