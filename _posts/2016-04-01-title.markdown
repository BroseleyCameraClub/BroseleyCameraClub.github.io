Broseley Camera Club is proud to present it's 2016 Exhibition.

## Black and White

Our members have submitted some of their best black and white images for this exhibition, showing off the high level of skills within such a small club.

The exhibition will run from the 1st April - 30th June 2016. Everyone is welcome to view the images on display, although it would be a good idea to check if the Birch Meadow Center is open on the day your looking to come along.

We will be adding an Exhibition Gallery to our website, however, not until the exhibition is over.
