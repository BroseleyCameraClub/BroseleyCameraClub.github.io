#### Presentation

The evenings presentation was on *Shapes and Architecture*, although this wasn't an 'in-depth' discussion on camera settings, we did discuss how to use shapes and composition to look at this subject differently.

Slides were given on the several tips, and we would encourage all members to get out and practice.

Full details of this will be in the members newsletter.

*Members receive a copy of the presentation in the club newsletter.*
