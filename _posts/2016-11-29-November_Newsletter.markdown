This evening we a departed from our usual format, in that we were entertained by Van Greaves FRPS,  our guest speaker for the night.

Known by John Horton since the late 1960’s, Van is a professional photographer specialising in landscape photography – though of late he has diversified into photography of butterflies and birds. Since gaining his RPS fellowship in the 1990’s he has had number of books published that include “Moods of Shropshire & The Marches” and “Worcestershire & Elgar Country”.

The evening contained a number of ‘Audio Visual’ sequences including the ‘Venetian Carnival’, ‘Balloons over Cappadocia’ and various aspects of the British landscape. It should be noted that the main technique was the care taken with the composition of the image: layers, leading lines and so forth. A short Q & A session followed each AV presentation.
