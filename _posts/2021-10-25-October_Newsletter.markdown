We had a more chilled evening, discussing the club future, programme, and other general items surrounding the club.

There wasn't particularly a focus point, we looked into a video documentary from a young photography's journey. This made all members who were able to attend see things from a different perspective and instead of getting caught up in lenses, cameras, lights and settings, it showed how others look at the creative process and how to create the image and not worry about the gear.

Full details of this will be in the members newsletter.
