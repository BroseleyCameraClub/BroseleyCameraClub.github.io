The programme we set out each year is not only to discuss different technical aspect of photography, different topics of photography, but also to inspire our members to get out and practice, and research different aspects of photography, particularly the areas they enjoy the most.

We also help individually through out the year on our outings and talks, every meeting has time for members to mingle and ask the more 'experienced' members questions.

Here are a few images form...
